-- ============================================================================================
-- Darling security hardening (#1262) — least-privilege role provisioning for BRING-YOUR-OWN
-- PostgreSQL (postgres.managed = false).
--
-- In managed mode the service provisions these roles automatically on every start (see
-- DarlingManagedRoles) and generates their DPAPI credentials. In BYO mode YOU run this script
-- once, as the database OWNER (the role that owns the Darling store — the one your
-- postgres.connectionString connects as for collection). It creates the two least-privilege
-- login roles the Viewer connects as instead of the owner:
--
--   admin   -- reads both schemas + writes the operator-config tables (mute rules, alert
--              dismissals, analysis mutes). The Viewer's default identity (darling.json
--              postgres.connectAs = "admin").
--   viewer  -- reads both schemas; its writes are the narrow, enumerated web-surface set: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
--              on config.custom_views (the user-authored view definitions, #1563), on
--              config.database_state_expected (the per-database override editor, #1986), and on
--              config.config_mute_rules (the web dashboard's dedicated mute-rule endpoints, #3450 -- plus the
--              two config_service beacon columns their bump trigger writes as the caller). All non-secret
--              tables; over the web every write is gated server-side by the host's auth + seat model -- these
--              grants are only the floor beneath that gate. All other write actions degrade gracefully. Point
--              a locked-down Viewer at this with postgres.connectAs = "viewer".
--
-- PREREQUISITE: the V8 migration (which the service applies on startup) must already have created
-- the collect and config schemas and moved the tables into them. Run this AFTER the service has
-- started at least once against your store. Re-running after a later schema upgrade is safe and
-- idempotent: the GRANT ... ON ALL TABLES statements below re-cover every table that now exists
-- (including the V17 control-plane tables config_monitored_servers / config_alert_settings /
-- config_notification / config_collector_schedules / config_service / config_command), and the
-- ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES already auto-grant any config table the owner creates after this runs. The
-- writes that are NOT covered by re-running blindly are the single-table viewer grants in steps 3b-3d:
-- each names a table (or, for 3d's beacon columns, a trigger dependency) a specific migration creates —
-- custom_views is V31, database_state_expected is V49, and the mute-rule reload-beacon trigger is V117 —
-- so re-run this script after upgrading past each.
--
-- BEFORE RUNNING:
--   1. Replace CHANGE_ME_ADMIN_PASSWORD and CHANGE_ME_VIEWER_PASSWORD with strong passwords.
--   2. If your database is not named "darling", change it in the REVOKE/GRANT ... ON DATABASE
--      lines and in the ALTER DATABASE note at the bottom.
--   3. If the owner role is not "darling", change it in the ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE
--      lines (it must be the role that CREATEs the tables — your collection connection's role).
--
--   psql -h <host> -U <owner> -d darling -f provision-roles.sql
--
-- NAME-COLLISION SAFETY: the roles are the bare, un-prefixed names "admin" and "viewer". If your
-- cluster ALREADY has a role by either name that this script did not create, it will NOT be silently
-- repurposed: fresh roles are stamped with a marker comment ('darling-managed'), and an existing
-- same-named role without that marker makes this script FAIL LOUD (rename or drop the other role
-- first, or use a dedicated cluster/database for the Darling store).
-- ============================================================================================

-- 1. Roles (CREATE ROLE has no IF NOT EXISTS -> guard with a DO block). Idempotent: re-running
--    this script re-asserts the password below, so it doubles as a password rotation. A fresh role
--    is stamped 'darling-managed'; an unmarked same-named role fails loud (never repurposed).

-- 1a. statement_timeout backstop on viewer (Custom Views v2, #1563): the web dashboard's compose surface
--     connects as viewer and runs network-reachable aggregations over a raw, no-rollup store, so this caps a
--     runaway query at the database (a LIMIT bounds output, not work). Keep this value in step with
--     ComposeLimits.StatementTimeout in the service. (Managed mode also sets this on the network 'mcp' role,
--     which a BYO deployment does not create -- your own PostgreSQL governs any MCP-role exposure it wants.)
ALTER ROLE viewer SET statement_timeout = '15s';

-- 2. Schema usage + SELECT on everything that exists now (ALL TABLES covers tables AND views). collect
--    holds no secrets, so admin+viewer read all of it. config: admin (the writer, and the Settings
--    window's identity) reads every column; viewer reads all config tables too -- MINUS the secret columns
--    carved in step 2b.
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA collect, config TO admin, viewer;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA collect TO admin, viewer;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA config  TO admin, viewer;

-- 2b. Credential-column fail-closed ACLs (#1262). The read-only viewer must NOT read the secret columns of
--     the three credential-bearing config tables: config_monitored_servers.encrypted_password (a DPAPI
--     password blob), config_command.args_json (the inline test_connect credential blob), and
--     config_notification's SMTP password/username + the Teams/Slack/generic webhook URLs and the generic
--     channel's headers (a webhook URL is a bearer secret, and generic_headers carries the Authorization
--     token itself). Instead of GRANT-ALL-then-REVOKE-each-secret (fail-OPEN -- a future secret column leaks until
--     someone revokes it), DROP viewer's table-wide SELECT on each and re-grant ONLY the non-secret columns
--     (fail-CLOSED -- a column added later is invisible to viewer until you add it below). admin keeps its
--     table-wide SELECT from step 2. Re-running this whole script re-asserts the carve idempotently. If a
--     later schema upgrade ADDS a column to any of these three tables, add it to the matching GRANT list
--     below (or, if it is itself secret, deliberately leave it out).
--
--     SOURCE OF TRUTH: DarlingManagedRoles.ViewerRestrictedConfigTables (the C# list managed mode builds its
--     identical carve from). These three GRANT lists are a HAND MIRROR of it, and hand mirrors drift -- they
--     did, silently, for three releases (see #1639). The ungated ProvisionRolesAclDriftTests parses THIS FILE
--     and asserts set-equality against that C# list, so adding a column to one side without the other now
--     fails the build. Keep the columns in the C# list's order so the two read as the same list.

-- 3. config writes -- admin only.
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA config TO admin;

-- 3b. Custom views (#1563): the SINGLE viewer write. The web dashboard connects as the least-privilege
--     viewer role and its custom-view composer writes exactly this one config table (non-secret dashboard
--     JSON). Editing is any authenticated seat -- the web surface's normal networked mode, gated server-side
--     by the host's token+CIDR auth (not loopback-only); this narrow grant is only the floor beneath that
--     gate. EXPLICIT single-table statement, NO ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES (ADP has no per-table
--     form -> it would broaden viewer to ALL of config). config.custom_views is created by the V31 migration,
--     so re-run this script AFTER the service has migrated your store to V31 (else this line errors: no table).
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON config.custom_views TO viewer;

-- 3c. Database-state expected states (#1986): the viewer's per-database override editor writes this one
--     config table (non-secret; the expected/(ignore) state per database). SELECT is already covered by
--     the blanket config grant in step 3; this is the write floor for the editor, gated server-side by the
--     same token+CIDR auth as the custom-view composer. EXPLICIT single-table statement (no ALTER DEFAULT
--     PRIVILEGES, which would broaden viewer to ALL of config). config.database_state_expected is created by
--     the V49 migration, so re-run this script AFTER the service has migrated your store to V49.
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON config.database_state_expected TO viewer;

-- 3d. Mute rules (#3450): the web dashboard's dedicated mute-rule endpoints (create / update / set-enabled /
--     delete under /api/mute-rules) run as this role, so it gets the same single-table write shape as 3b/3c.
--     The table exists from V3, but its reload-beacon trigger (trg_bump_mute_rules, V117) is SECURITY INVOKER
--     and UPDATEs config_service.config_version AS viewer on every mute-rule write -- so the COLUMN-level
--     config_service grant below is load-bearing, not optional: without it every web mute-rule write fails
--     42501 at the trigger. Column-level on exactly the two beacon columns, so viewer can bump the reload
--     beacon but never flip a service flag like paused. Re-run this script after upgrading to V117+.
--     (The WPF Viewer's read-only probe discriminates on config_alert_log UPDATE -- a write viewer never
--     gets -- so a connectAs = "viewer" Viewer stays read-only in its UI despite this grant.)
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON config.config_mute_rules TO viewer;
GRANT UPDATE (config_version, updated_at) ON config.config_service TO viewer;

-- 4. Default privileges so NEW tables/views (future collectors, created bare into collect via
--    search_path) auto-inherit SELECT. FOR ROLE <owner> must name the role that creates them.

-- sequence USAGE to INSERT (unlike serial) -- but keep this fail-closed grant so a future serial
-- config column would still work without a follow-up migration.
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE darling IN SCHEMA config
   GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO admin;

-- 5. Public hardening: no world-writable public schema, no anonymous connect. REVOKE ALL drops
--    PUBLIC's implicit CONNECT, so admin/viewer are re-granted CONNECT explicitly.
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE darling FROM PUBLIC;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE darling TO admin, viewer;

-- 6. Search path. The service best-effort runs this on every start, but if your collection login
--    lacks the database-owner privilege it needs, run it once yourself as the owner so every
--    connection (the Viewer, psql, pg_dump) resolves the bare table names to collect/config:
--
--       ALTER DATABASE darling SET search_path = collect, config, public;
