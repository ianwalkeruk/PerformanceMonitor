        /* V71 (the PostgreSQL blocking-edges rung): a table-existence sentinel and now the newest-first arm.
           A collector table would ordinarily get no arm at all — see the V63-V69 note below — but the TOP
           rung always needs one, whatever it happens to be, because RequiredStoreSchemaVersion is
           StorageVersion.SchemaVersion and a fully-migrated store must map to EXACTLY that or the version
           banner reports a mismatch on a store that is current. Being a collector table makes it no less
           reliable as a sentinel; it simply is not interesting for any other reason.

           Deliberately NOT spelled with its collect.<table> name here, and this is the only place in the
           file where that matters. ViewerCollectorCoverageTests scans this reader layer for collector table
           names by plain substring to decide which tables the viewer actually reads; it strips the probe's
           information_schema lines precisely so a migration sentinel cannot fake coverage, but a PROSE
           mention has no such line to strip. Naming the table in this comment made the table look read,
           which silently exempted it from the coverage ratchet — the exact failure that pin exists to
           catch, reported as a stale allow-list entry. */
        /* V72 (the Query Store plan map, #2210): table-existence sentinel, and it has to sit ABOVE the V71
           arm because these are evaluated newest-first — a V72 store also has V71's table, so testing V71
           first would report every V72 store as V71 and the viewer would show a spurious upgrade banner
           against a store that is actually current.

           The gate matters rather than being bookkeeping: the SERVICE writes this map on every plan fetch and
           resolves plan XML through it, so a viewer pointed at a V71 store while the service expects V72 would
           find no map rows and render every plan as "not yet collected" — indistinguishable from a healthy
           store that simply has not fetched yet, which is the one failure mode this design works hardest to
           avoid being silent about.

           The table is named in the probe line above and deliberately NOT in this prose, per the V71 arm's

           The reason to gate is the standing invariant rather than a read that would throw — no viewer query
           names this column; the SERVICE's alert adapter is what reads it. RequiredStoreSchemaVersion is
           StorageVersion.SchemaVersion, so a fully-migrated store has to map to EXACTLY this or the banner
           reports a mismatch on a store that is current. What the banner buys on the way is worth having: a
           store still at 80 has no ceiling recorded anywhere in its history, so every tempdb percentage in it
           is the old distance-to-next-autogrow measurement, and the operator should know that before reading
