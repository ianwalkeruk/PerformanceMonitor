           on current code referenced a column three rungs before the ALTER that adds it (42703, the
           ladder halts, every 3.3.0→3.4.0 upgrade failed). V54's ALTERs are idempotent, so pre-adding
           here costs a fresh-through-this-rung store nothing and rung 54's own copy no-ops. This is
           the standing hazard of generator-built rungs: any LATER column the generator learns must be
           pre-added in EVERY earlier rung that re-emits generated SQL over existing tables — pinned by

           compiled from TODAY's payload column list, so this rung's re-emission names every payload column
           the current build knows — including ones a LATER rung adds. A store climbing from an older release
           reaches this rung first, so without those columns the view references one that does not exist yet
           and the ladder stops at 42703.

           Generated from the collector definition rather than by threading a specific later rung's SQL in
           here: one column was the symptom, and the next payload column would need this edited again. Every
           statement is ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS, so a store that already has them is unaffected. */
