/// <item><b><c>viewer</c></b> — SELECT on both schemas, plus a NARROW, enumerated set of writes: the web
/// dashboard's write surfaces run as this role, so it holds INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on
/// <c>config.custom_views</c> (#1563, the user-authored view definitions), <c>config.custom_alert_rules</c>
/// (#3285, the user-authored alert rules), <c>config.database_state_expected</c> (#1986, the Viewer's

/// endpoints — plus the two <c>config_service</c> beacon columns its bump trigger writes as the caller).
/// All non-secret tables; over the web, editing is gated server-side by the host's auth + the seat model
/// (an OIDC viewer seat is refused every write) — these grants are only the floor beneath that gate. A
/// locked-down deployment points the Viewer at this role, and its WPF surfaces still read as "look but

GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE {database} TO {mcp};

-- 7. Custom views (#1563): the SINGLE exception to viewer-writes-nothing, and the mcp role's ONLY write outside
--    the two section-6 analysis INSERTs. Both the web dashboard (as the viewer role) and the optional network MCP
--    surface (as the mcp role) CRUD rows in exactly this one config table (non-secret dashboard/notebook JSON --
--    no ViewerRestrictedConfigTables carve). The web composer and the MCP custom-view tools share ONE store
--    (CustomViewStore) + ONE validator (DarlingWebEndpoints.ValidateDefinition), so the two write identities need
--    the identical narrow grant. Editing is any AUTHENTICATED seat -- the surfaces' normal networked mode, gated
--    server-side by the host's token+CIDR auth (web token/cookie; MCP bearer token) NOT loopback-only; this DB
--    grant is only the narrow floor beneath that gate. EXPLICIT single-table statements (one per identity) with
--    NO ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES, mirroring the narrow analysis-write grants above (ADP has no per-table form ->
--    an ADP write would broaden the role to ALL of config); provisioning re-runs every start, so a recreated
--    table re-grants (self-heal). The target must already exist here, so provisioning runs AFTER migration (V31
--    created config.custom_views). id is GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (like config_command), so the INSERT needs
--    no sequence USAGE grant.

-- carve, no config_command pivot). Created by V116, so provisioning runs after migration. NOTE: the sibling
-- config.custom_alert_state is written by the CustomAlertEvaluator on the OWNER pool only, so it deliberately

GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON {config}.database_state_expected TO {viewer};

-- 8. Alert tuning (the MCP alert-tuning write tools): the mcp role's alert-config writes, mirroring section 7's
--    custom_views grant model (EXPLICIT single-table statements, NO ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES). update_alert_settings
--    / create_mute_rule / update_mute_rule / delete_mute_rule / set_mute_rule_enabled let a token-holder tune the SAME alert engine the Viewer's Settings
--    window drives: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on config_mute_rules (the mute rules the delivery paths honor) and UPDATE
--    on the SINGLETON config_alert_settings row (id=1 -- UPDATE only, never INSERT/DELETE: the row is a fixed
--    singleton the service seeds). Still NARROW -- never the config_command service-credential pivot, a
--    schema-wide config write, or any SECRET column: the one config_notification write is a single column
--    (see #3314 below), and the monitored-servers credential column stays SELECT-carved.
--    The beacon caveat: a config_alert_settings write fires the existing statement-level bump trigger
--    (trg_bump_alert_settings -> config_bump_version), which UPDATEs config_service.config_version AS THE CURRENT
--    ROLE (the trigger function is SECURITY INVOKER). So mcp ALSO needs UPDATE on JUST the two beacon columns of
--    config_service, or every update_alert_settings write would fail 42501 in production -- and the superuser-run
--    gated-live tests would never catch it (they connect as the owner). A COLUMN-level grant lets mcp bump the
--    reload beacon but NOT flip paused / capture_plans / mcp_enabled / mcp_port. The targets exist here because
--    provisioning runs AFTER migration; a recreated table re-grants on the next start (self-heal).
--    EVERY mcp-writable beacon-triggered table rests on that one grant, not the alert-settings path alone:
--    config_mute_rules carries trg_bump_mute_rules (V117 / #3315) and config_monitored_servers carries
--    trg_bump_monitored_servers (section 9), so create_mute_rule / update_mute_rule / delete_mute_rule / set_mute_rule_enabled and add_servers /
--    remove_server bump the beacon as mcp too. Narrowing the grant to update_alert_settings 42501s all of
--    them -- one column UPDATE serves every trigger. Re-derive the set from which mcp-writable tables carry a
--    bump trigger rather than from a count recorded here, which a later rung ages out without changing it.

-- #3450: the web dashboard's dedicated mute-rule endpoints (POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE under /api/mute-rules) run
--    as the least-privilege viewer role -- the web host's ONLY store identity -- so viewer gets the SAME
--    single-table config_mute_rules write mcp holds above, the shape of the custom_views/custom_alert_rules
--    pairs in section 7. The SEAT model, not this grant, decides who may call the endpoints (an OIDC viewer
--    seat is refused every unsafe method by the host's write gate); this is only the narrow floor beneath that
--    gate. The section-8 beacon caveat applies verbatim: config_mute_rules carries trg_bump_mute_rules ->
--    config_bump_version (SECURITY INVOKER), which UPDATEs config_service.config_version AS viewer, so viewer
--    needs the same two-column config_service grant mcp has -- and no more (paused / capture_plans / mcp_port
--    stay out of reach; the column grant serves the trigger, never a service flag). One consequence is owned
--    where it bites: the WPF Viewer's read-only probe used to ask has_table_privilege on exactly this table's
--    INSERT, which this grant would have flipped to ''writable'' for a connectAs = ''viewer'' seat whose
--    alert-dismiss writes still 42501 -- the probe now discriminates on config_alert_log UPDATE
--    (ViewerDataService.ReadOnlyProbeSql), a write only admin/owner hold, so the locked-down Viewer's
--    read-only UX is unchanged by this grant.

-- #3314: the DELIVERY cooldown -- the sole throttle on a Slack/Teams/PagerDuty/webhook post -- is the one
-- alert-engine knob stored on config_notification rather than config_alert_settings, so update_alert_settings
-- spans two tables and needs a write here. This DOES widen mcp into a table holding bearer secrets (the SMTP
-- password blob, the Teams/Slack/generic webhook URLs, the PagerDuty routing key), so the grant is
-- COLUMN-level on exactly that one column -- the same shape as the config_service beacon grant above and for
-- the same reason. MEASURED, not assumed: as mcp, the baseline UPDATE raises 42501; with this grant it
-- succeeds; with the column SELECT revoked and this grant kept it STILL succeeds (so UPDATE is the privilege
-- doing the work, not an ambient SELECT); and a write to smtp_encrypted_password, slack_url or even the
-- non-secret sibling smtp_host stays 42501. A missing SELECT and a missing UPDATE both raise the identical
-- 42501 permission-denied-for-table-config_notification message, so only isolating the grants separates them.
-- The READ side needs nothing: email_cooldown_minutes is already in the section-6 non-secret column carve.
-- The BEACON is already covered: config_notification carries trg_bump_notification -> config_bump_version
-- (SECURITY INVOKER), which UPDATEs config_service.config_version AS mcp, and the column grant above serves it.
GRANT UPDATE (email_cooldown_minutes) ON {config}.config_notification TO {mcp};

-- 9. Server onboarding (the MCP server-admin write tools): the mcp role's monitored-server writes, mirroring
--    sections 7/8's model (an EXPLICIT single-table statement, NO ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES). add_servers /
--    remove_server let a token-holder add or remove monitored servers in the SAME central store the Viewer's
--    Add / Manage-Servers dialogs write: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on config_monitored_servers. Still NARROW -- a
--    single non-secret-KEY table (the encrypted_password column is SELECT-carved from mcp by the section-6
--    secret-column ACL above, so mcp can WRITE a credential blob but never READ one back), never the
--    config_command service-credential pivot or a schema-wide config write. The BEACON is already covered: a
--    config_monitored_servers write fires trg_bump_monitored_servers -> config_bump_version (SECURITY INVOKER),
--    which UPDATEs config_service.config_version AS mcp, and section 8 already granted mcp
--    UPDATE (config_version, updated_at) ON config_service -- so no additional config_service grant is needed here.
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON {config}.config_monitored_servers TO {mcp};

-- 10. Custom-alert resolve-on-delete privileged write (#3334). The recovery/resolution row a caller-initiated
--     rule DELETE writes (CustomAlertEvaluator.WriteTeardownResolutionAsync) lands in config.config_alert_log,
--     which ONLY admin/owner may INSERT (section 3's schema-wide grant). But that delete runs as the
--     least-privilege caller -- mcp (the delete_custom_alert_rule tool) or viewer (DELETE /api/alerts) -- so a
--     direct INSERT is permission-denied, the write is failure-isolated, and the resolution row #3305 intends
--     was SILENTLY dropped, leaving a deleted firing rule showing ""open"" in history forever. Rather than a
--     blanket INSERT grant on the history table to viewer/mcp (which would let those roles fabricate ARBITRARY
--     history rows, including fake fires), a SECURITY DEFINER function confines the privileged write to EXACTLY
--     a no-channel resolution row: every delivery-shape column is HARDCODED (alert_sent false, notification_type
--     'none', current/threshold 0, muted false, no send_error/context) -- the same zeroed/unmuted resolution
--     shape BuildResolutionRecord + PgAlertHistoryStore.RecordAlertAsync write, but pinned to a NO-CHANNEL row
--     rather than a natural clear's 'tray' (a teardown surfaces no operator notification) -- so a caller can
--     page nothing and fabricate no fire; only server_id/name and the already-sanitized title/detail vary.
--     Definer-safe: owned by the store owner (the creating provisioning role, {owner}), an explicit pinned
--     search_path so no injected path can redirect the unqualified config_alert_log or now(), and a fully
--     parameterized INSERT with NO dynamic SQL. Created + REVOKEd-from-PUBLIC by the shared builder below;
--     EXECUTE is the only privilege the least-privilege roles get, and admin/owner keep their direct INSERT and
--     never call it. NOT a versioned migration: CREATE OR REPLACE is idempotent and owner-run every start and
--     has no probeable schema footprint (the section-1c role-SET rationale), so a V-number would drag in the
--     probe rung + ladder fixture + version-pin tests for no gain.
